          "caption": "powered by AppMagic.rocks 😎\n\nA deeper look into the RPG Genre with the top two sub-genres: Team battlers and Action RPG, which have about the same game count AND the same gross rev of $7.1B and $7.5B, respectively — even the Rev per Download for both subgenres are about $13.50.  These are GLOBAL numbers, but once we divided them into Tier-1 Western markets, we see that the top gross revenue subgenre is Team Battlers at $1.6B then  Action RPG at less than half at $700M.  The RpDs are slightly different with Team battlers at $11 and ARPG at $8.  Now, we take flight to our Tier-1 Eastern markets and these numbers go wild.\n\nThe top subgenres by gross rev are ARPG at $6.1B and Team battlers at $5B with RpD range between $26 and $30.  This is 3x'd that of the Western markets.  Simply wow.  The sleeper here is actually the subgenre Open World which pulled in a $46 RpD.  This is your Genshin Impact and Diablo Immortal titles.  Ludicrous!\n\nGLOBAL\nSubgenre (Game Count) / Rev / Downloads\nTeam Battlers (2.7k) / $7.1B / 514M\nAction RPG (2.7k) / $7.5B / 513M\nOpen World (104) / $2.9B / 146M\nMOBA (89) / $2.8B / $205M\n\nYou can view my dashboard here:\nhttps://appmagic.rocks/dashboards/6393fcd0abf91?promoCode=6373c4a19d368\n\n",
