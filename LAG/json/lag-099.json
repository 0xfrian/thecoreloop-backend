  "special_insights": "powered by AppMagic.rocks 😎\nApex Legends: Mobile was released in May this year.  Let's check in on how they're doing the past 6 months.  The game had two high months in May and June with a monthly rev of $7.2M and $7.1M, respectively.  Since then the game has tapered off in the $3.5M range for the past two months.  Similarly, we see the same pattern in the downloads with a peak at a whopping 15.8M downloads in May.  Recently, the downloads tapered off in the 1.5M per month range.  The lifetime revenue has been $33.5M with 32.8M downloads.  The good news is that the game GM figured out how to monetize because the rev per download increased drastically from the low $0.30 in May to a high of $1.00 in Nov.\nTomorrow, we're going to check out some other comps!",
