But some parts of the world are more receptive to Anime art style than others.  Today, I'm doing a comparison between the top 5 Anime style art games for the East vs. West.\n\nYTD 2022\nEast: $2.36B rev √∑ 24M download = $98  RpD\nvs.\nWest: $575M rev √∑ 15.15M download = $38 RpD\n\nThe East has magnitudes more powerful monetization mechanics and/or high spending behaviors.  The West clearly isn't keeping up with their eastern counterparts.  Though the top game in both regions (Fate/Grand Order) is the same, the RpD is $419 vs. $118.\n\nFirst come, first served.
