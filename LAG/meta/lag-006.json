In World of Warcraft (WoW), guilds were formed so that people could collaborate in an organized manner to do 10, 25 or even 40-man raids against bosses. The top guilds commonly compete against each other for ‚ÄúWorld First Kills‚Äù after new content is released. WoW guilds often act like a large corporation where there would be various management roles given to senior members of the guilds. In WoW, selected guild members would be placed in charge of managing different assignments based on individual skill and preference. For example, Tank, DPS, and Healing assignments.",
