Surprisingly, this is a low number (not counting Pokemon GO!).\nThat's why Nintendo is partnering up with DeNA, a large mobile publisher with $$2.4B in lifetime rev but only 127M downloads.  Clearly, DeNA monetizes their users nearly 9x better than Nintendo does.\nMy Dashboard (Warning Paywall'd but I gave the TLDR above.
